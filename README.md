# About Me

I'm [__@unstatistical__](https://github.com/unstatistical), a hobbyist developer. My favorite language is C++, but I also enjoy TypeScript. For games, I mainly use SDL, but I will occasionally use a little OpenGL and GLFW. I enjoy writing and interacting with interpreters and compilers. I am interested in operating systems. I like C++ because it is so simple and fast, and that is also why I prefer it to TypeScript. I am not too good at makefiles, but there will likely be a makefile in most of my projects. I enjoy listening to seventies, eighties, and nineties rock music. Math is another one of my hobbies.
