# Hello, World!

I'm unstatistical, a student and hobbyist developer in high school as of September 2024. I hope for programing, buisness and finance classes, as well as advanced math. I use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as my primary operating system. I use Visual Studio Code for programming. My favorite language is C++. I use the gruvbox theme. I use AI assisted development tools, but with caution. My favorite core class in school is math. I enjoy classic rock music. I often read xkcd comics in my free time. I have an atrocious sense of humor.

__C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off.__
