__As a programmer, it is your job to put yourself out of business. What you do today can be automated tomorrow.__

_- Doug McIlroy_

## A Little About Me

I'm unstatistical. I don't use my real name for personal reasons. I'm a freshman in high school. I primarily use C/C++, or other low-level languages, because I enjoy the capabilities that you obtain the closer you get to straight machine code.

__C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off.__

_- Bjarne Stroustrup_

## Programming Languages

4. Java
5. V

6. RST

__There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always bitch about and those nobody uses.__

_-Bjarne Stroustrup_

## My Code

Typically, I use Google style guides for my code. My code may be sloppy, as I am self taught, but I'm working on it.

__One of my most productive days was throwing away 1,000 lines of code.__
